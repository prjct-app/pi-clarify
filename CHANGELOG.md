# Changelog

## 0.1.4 — 2026-10-12

- Code: no `let` bindings; mutable state lives in one named object. Behaviour is unchanged.
- Tests run with temporary Pi and prjct folders, so they never touch your real configuration.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-10-11

- `clarify` is `model-only`: it waits for the person, so codemode scripts cannot call it.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-10-06

- Publish from an independent repository with its own checks, lockfile and declared npm dependencies. Preserve the extension history and install name.
